1.0.1:
	- Fixed some stability issues.
	- Decreased FPGA boot time.
1.0.0:
	- Fragmentation issues when loading through Swiss should be fixed now.
	- Added multi-disc support. Disc swapping is performed automatically.
0.9.0:
	- Lower disc speed emulation can be forced by turning DIP switch 4 on.
	Currently speed is throttled at ~3MB/s only. Eventually, it will be
	emulated more accurately.
0.10.0:
	- 'no disc' is simulated, when SD Card is not inserted or 'boot.iso' is
	missing.
