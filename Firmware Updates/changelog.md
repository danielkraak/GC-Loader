2.0.0.BETA:\
	- Added write support.\
	- New implementation for fragmented file handling.\
	- Improved SD Card compatibility:\
		- Fixed issue with PNY cards.\
		- Support for standard capacity cards\
	- Several small optimizations.\
1.1.2:\
	- Fixed stability issues encountered on certain boards (introduced in 1.1.1).\
1.1.1:\
	- Fixed random corrupted audiostreaming sound\
	- Added some small optimizations\
	- Cleaned up codebase.\
1.1.0:\
	- Added safe firmware updates (recovery firmware image is written).\
	- Workaround for hidden filenames (boot.iso.iso, boot.gcm.gcm are also detected at boot).\
1.0.1:\
    - Fixed some stability issues.\
    - Decreased FPGA boot time.\
1.0.0:\
    - Fragmentation issues when loading through Swiss should be fixed now.\
    - Added multi-disc support. Disc swapping is performed automatically.\
0.9.0:\
    - Lower disc speed emulation can be forced by turning DIP switch 4 on.\
    Currently speed is throttled at ~3MB/s only. Eventually, it will be\
    emulated more accurately.\
0.10.0:\
    - 'no disc' is simulated, when SD Card is not inserted or 'boot.iso' is\
    missing.
